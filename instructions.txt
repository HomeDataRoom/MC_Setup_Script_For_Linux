This document will go over how to run the 'MC Setup Script For Linux' script 
=====================================================================================================================


If you downloaded the .zip file, unzip the content and go into the 'scripts' folder inside of the project folder that you just unzipped
Give the MinecraftSetup.sh file execute permissions by running: 'chmod +x MinecraftSetup.sh'
Then execute the script using './MinecraftSetup.sh' or run: 'bash MinecraftSetup.sh' (make sure you're in the same folder as the script)

If you just downloaded the .sh file, give it execute permissions by running: 'chmod +x MinecraftSetup.sh'
Then execute the script using './MinecraftSetup.sh' (make sure you're in the same folder as the script)



You will be prompted to put in your administrative password, because you'll be updating your repos and packages, installing OpenJDK 19, and adding a directory for the Minecraft server in /opt. 
DO NOT RUN THIS AS ROOT!!!!! THAT IS A MAJOR SECURITY RISK!!!

1. Once your system is fully up to date and OpenJDK is installed, PaperMC 1.20.2 will be installed from the official PaperMC website
2. A new user and group will be created called 'minecraft' 
4. A minecraft directory will be made in '/opt'
5. The server will start, then it will stop because the EULA isn't agreed to
6. The EULA will be changed to 'true' and the server will start again
7. A simple start script will also be created at '/opt/minecraft/', called 'MC_Start.sh'
8. A systemd service will be created called 'minecraft.service' and it will use the 'minecraft' user as the account to run the service
9. The systemd service will be enabled and started
10. A collection of aliases will be added to a file called 'minecraft-aliases.sh' in '/etc/profile.d'
11. A final finish screen will be displayed explaining everything and giving a thank you for downloading this script

If your server/computer turns off, the Minecraft 
server does automatically turn back on when you
turn back on the server/computer; you will not 
have to turn it back on yourself. If the server
is off for any reason, you can run 'mcstart' and
it should turn on in a moment or two. 


Here are all of the aliases that were created:

   mcscreen - this brings up the Minecraft server console
     - to exit this screen press 'Ctrl' + 'a', then 'd'
   mcstart - this starts the Minecraft systemd service
   mcstop - this stops the Minecraft systemd service
   mcstatus - this checks the status of the Minecraft systemd service
   mcrestart - this restarts the Minecraft systemd service
   mcdisable - this disables the Minecraft systemd service (prevents auto start function)
   mcenable - this enables the Minecraft systemd service (enables the auto start function)

A lot of the older commands may still work from 
previous version of this script. However some-
things may not work like they used to, for example
'screen -r'. You will have to use 'mcscreen' if you
want to view the Minecraft server console.
